Job SummarySDE technology coaching and developmentSoftware Development Managers (SDMs) establish and sustain the environment for development to exist and succeed. Their primary focus is to hire, retain and develop our Software Development Engineers (SDEs) through creating and aligning individual\u2019s short- and long-term objectives and development plan alongside the goals of the wider team and business. They evolve the right tailored approaches to manage and develop their SDEs including regular 1-2-1 meetings, identifying mentors or mentees and providing impromptu coaching inputs. SDMs help split the scope of work across one or more SDEs depending on their strengths and areas of improvement. They actively work to set the SDEs up for success, providing course corrections as necessary. SDMs also help SDEs get the right mentorship to ensure they grow more expertise and to address any weaknesses hindering their effectiveness. Team structure and technology processes SDMs build effective, performing teams that consistently deliver quality software whilst balancing the demands of timeframes and needs. They put in place the ingredients for teams to succeed, including the right level of process, practices and data gathering to help the team constantly improve. SDMs default to granting teams autonomy but recognise when stronger guidance and help from them is needed. When the team is performing, an SDM offers a light-touch to assist in unblocking progress. When a team is struggling the SDM identifies and actions a plan to help. They build an effective customer engagement process to ensure their teams have awareness of the importance of good customer experience and show responsiveness to customer experience during development as well as in operational issues.They drive continuous improvement of engineering practises and efficiency of development within their team and foster innovation.
