Projects

Project Title: Genesis
Client: BitMinutes

 Skill Used: Blockchain, Project Management, Python, Customer Relationship, Business Development,
Role Description: Was part of the conception team, managed the development, and was also involved in the promotion
and soft launch of the project.
Project Details: Development and launch of a new Blockchain-based cryptocurrency called Bit Minutes. The beauty of this
currency is that its value is linked to the dollar equivalence of all prepaid minutes available in all participating mobile
networks and individuals. Thus this Cryptocurrency did have actual monetary base not based on hypothetical future work
equivalents or any other intangible value.

 
Project Title: MVTR (Mobile Virtual Trial Room)
Client: Among the largest American Fashion retailer

 Skill Used: AR, AI, Project Management, Delivery Management, Program Management, Engagement Management,
Role Description: Delivery and account management
Project Details: The MVTR (Mobile Virtual Trial Room) was an Augmented Reality project that aimed to provide the
customers with the facility of trying out apparel remotely without actually having to visit a store or change their clothes,
directly on a mobile handset. All they have to do was to stand in front of their mobile camera for the app to measure them,
then they could type in their actual height, weight, and other proportions if applicable and see themselves (animated 3D
rendering) wearing the selected cloth on video.

 
Project Title: Glass Salvage
Client: ETG

 Skill Used: Java, .Net, Project Management, Delivery Management, Engagement Management,
Role Description: Was Responsible for Complete delivery and additional revenue generation.
Project Details: GlassSalvage was an automatic Salvage value determination tool to be used by Vehicle dealers,

to provide a value of depreciated, accident impacted, weathered vehicles without actually having to mechanically evaluate
the broken vehicle based on a number of business parameters like, depreciation, quality of materials, years and distance
of use, number of times insurance claimed, number of times maintained, etc.

 
Project Title: True AV
Client: NHS (UK)

 Skill Used: Core Java, .Net, ASP.Net, Project Management,
Role Description: Managed 3 projects as part of the overall program concurrently.

mechanism for supporting patients at remote locations by NHS doctors. The aim was, besides providing medical services
remotely, to reduce the monthly operational expenditure of the Greater Manchester Area NHS by 24% between 2004 and
2006.
It also involved the development and support of tools to assist Doctors and health workers in supporting remote patients
like remote scanners, Voice to Text engines, remote case logging tools etc.
